BART2 COHORT
============

This is Anti-Reroviral Therapy cohort tool based on the application developed by 
Baobab Health Trust which runs on OpenMRS over MySQL.

Initially it has:
    - 1 view
    - 2 controllers although the main one is one
    - 2 models
    
It expects a path of the format:

    http://localhost:3000/cohort?start_date=2013-01-01&end_date=2013-04-04
    
that is, it expects at least 2 parameters which are:

    - start_date and
    - end_date
    
to run.

The fields are loaded dynamically using AJAX and the different iitems have individual methods that populate them.

Happy coding!

Baobab Health Trust Software Crew!
